**SPACE MUNCH GAME**

Game Description
    In SPACE MUNCH, players control an astronaut delivering pizzas in the vast expanse of space. Each level presents unique 
    challenges with different moons and random ships appearing that also require timely pizza deliveries. 
    As you successfully complete each level, the rope connecting you to your spaceship will increase in length, 
    adding a layer of complexity to your movement and strategy.

Gameplay Mechanics
    Objective: Deliver pizzas to aliens on moons and random ships, and achieve the tip goals to progress through the game.
    Challenges: Aliens and ship crews have patience levels that decrease over time. Deliver pizzas before their patience runs out to earn tips.
    Levels: The game features three levels, each increasing in difficulty with more challenging delivery demands and longer ropes connecting the astronaut to the spaceship.
    Controls
    Movement: Use the Arrow Keys to navigate your astronaut and spaceship across the space map.
    Stop Motion: Press the Spacebar to stop the motion of your spaceship and astronaut.
    Pause Menu: Press the Escape key to access the pause menu.
    
Work distribution:
    Omry mostly worked on the moons, spaceships and the player.
    Noa worked on UI, level design, and transiton and the meteors
   NOTE: Our bezelal partners were really helpful and contributed a lot.
   
    
Problems we encountered
    -Building the rope: learning how to make a rope work in zero-gravity is very difficult, it took us a few hours to understand how to implement a fairly good rope.  
    We think it can be improved, we saw a tutorial by sebestian lague on how ti implement a better working, more realisitic rope, but due to time constraints we didnt get to it.
    -Github: Our main difficulty was working with github. This was our first time working as a group with a program like github and we had to redo a few things due to accidently deleting them/ overwriting them.
    we had problems syncing our work with the designers and wasted a lot of time fixing merge bugs
    

PlayTest and feedback
    -During playtest we got a few comments saying they didnt know what the goal is and when they are close to winning the game.
    As a result we added particles that move towards the tip indicator to show the player his progress
    -We added a tutorial because players didnt understand the objective of the game
    -We added transition and a winning screen because players didnt like the immediate transfer between scenes.
    
 
 Bugs
    Occaasianaly when getting hit by a meteor your spaceship moves very slow, Until you press the space bar
    Once leaving the moon in the middle of transferring pizza all sounds might stop abruptly
    -Rope might become "broken" pretty rarely (mostly when going at high speeds). Adding bounciness to the walls reduced this effect.
